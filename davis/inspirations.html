  <h1> Some of the inspirations that i had were gaming channels like jacksepticeye and markiplier who make funny gaming videos 
  like what i am trying to do.Some other channels that i like which i whant to make videos like is good mythical morning which does inane 
    things like make wierd versions of foods and sees if they are good or not.like making a pie made out og squid.I also whant to start to make 
    aniomated videos like on the channel jaiden animations or the odd 1's oput.They are both kinda like a bloging channel but they can show 
    show fake crazy things and also things that happened in the past.</h1>
