  <h1> Motivation For This Project</h1>
  <br>
  <h2>The author and celebrity John Green has a YouTube channel called Crash Course where he teaches people about content in the social studies and science branch of academics. Crash Course is the inspiration for our channel, as we are going to give information in a similar fashion. We chose this project idea because weâ€™ve always wanted to have a YouTube channel to express our ideas and ways of thinking. Our goal is to educate others with our videos, while learning things for ourselves at the same time. This is worthwhile because in doing this we will learn a lot based on our information, and learn what it is like to have a YouTube channel. Another piece of inspiration was from TedEd, which also creates videos teaching fundamental and also complex topics in a simple animated way.

  <h1> Materials We Will be Needing</h1>
  <br>
  <h2>We will need editing equipment, a recording device, and maybe an area to record, most probably our own house(s). We will also be using different researching tools like our computers for researching facts and editing our videos. Our materials vary upon project to project as our videos include different topics, which allow different materials to be used. We will most use 1 marker and a whiteboard, which is featured in our video. 
</h2>
  <br>
  <h1>Main Steps</h1>
  <br>
  <h2>In order to complete this project we will need to get information and record videos. We will record in a way where one person will draw on a white board and the other will record in time-lapse, a sped-up version of recording. This will create a visual image for the viewer to better teach him/her. Then, after recording, we will voice-over the recording with the content being shown on the fast-forwarded drawing. And finally, we will post our finished product on YouTube. 
</h2>
  <br>
  <h1>Time</h1>
  <br>
  <h2>Between researching, recording, voice recording, meeting each other and editing, each video will take about 1 to 2 weeks to make, so it will take about a few months to make a sufficient amount of videos. This project is unlike many others as there is no end to this project, since we can keep on producing videos. Specific milestones may be reaching a specific number of subscribers, our 10th video, or even our first sort of payment from Google!
</h2>
  <br>
  <h1>Resources</h1>
  <br>
  <h2>We will use a Google operated service called YouTube Creator Studio to manage our YouTube channel, and also create and edit videos. Unlike some other projects, our mentor(s) will be books, research sources, and other educational videos themselves. We are doing a similar sort of project like Crash Course and TedEd, but we will make this project our own by creating videos involving fast-forwarded drawings rather than animations, like Crash Course and Ted-Ed create.
</h2>
  <br>
  <h1>Difficulties</h1>
  <br>
  <h2>Our project will be very successful, but there might be difficulties that will occur for us to overcome them. Some challenges could include, our cameras not working due to insufficient power, internet not working to not allow us to post videos on YouTube, other newly formed YouTubers competing against us, and even our viewers not being satisfied with our content. We can overcome these by being responsible and also being aware of our circumstaces
</h2>
  <br>
  <h1>Sharing and Evaluation</h1>
  <br>
  <h2>We will share our videos through a Google operated service called YouTube. YouTube is a program which is free for everybody who has the access to internet to use. Our channel, Quick Concepts will be posted on YouTube for everybody to watch and learn from. Again, our target audience will be elementary level students, and we will teach them topics which we have already found a way to master. 

  As you already know that YouTube is a free to use facility, we strongly encourage viewers to evaluate us by leave comments on our videos, and explaining what we can do better as a YouTube channel. In this way, our progress can be measured by you as everybody in this class and by our viewers have used YouTube before. As an addition to this, we will also do self evaluations, by setting up polls, feedback forms, and also internal team reviews. We will put the link to a google forms in the description for efficient polling.
