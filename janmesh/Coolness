The Islam Essay


	The Islamic religion had a very significant impact on the daily lives of Islam. Islam itself is a very strict religion, and enforces its rules, regulations, and laws very crucially upon its people. It would actually be considered to be an extremist religion, because if a muslim does not follow a rule, he or she may be forced to death as a punishment for not following it. The five pillars of the religion of Islam include many actions necessary to be performed by all muslims. The Shahada says to recite Islam in the most sincerest way possible, the Salat says to perform ritual prayers five times in a day, in the correct way and position, and the Zakat states that a muslim should give alms or charity to the poor everyday to benefit the poor in their surroundings. These are just the three of the five pillars of Islam which have to do with daily actions. These three pillars influence what muslims do throughout their day majorly. Thinking from a point of view originating from an economist, Islam’s economy affected muslim’s lives in many perspectives.The religion of Islam has a major impact on its muslim followers, even from an economist sort of thinking. 
First, the muslims used and still use a free market principle, meaning that if a person lends money to someone else, the person who is giving the money cannot collect interest from the taker. This principle had a great impact on the way banks are operated and how money was exchanged throughout the Islamic world. It allowed people to acquire money that they desperately needed so that they could start a business or even simply maintain a household without losing any money. The Prohibition of interest taking is called Riba.
Next, the Zakat pillar states that a muslim has to give alms or charity to the poor everyday, to make everybody able to and have a potential to maintain a household and survive through bare necessities, instead of dying in the brittle cold night with little to no clothing, starved and homeless. This charity and giving alms applies to only middle class people, who can afford to give only some of their wealth away, The story is different with the higher, wealthier class. A person or household from the higher class has to give ten whole percent of their earnings to the poor so that everybody, once again, has a chance of not being a poor person. Through this process, the circulation of money is balanced so that everybody has equal status in the society. 
Since muslims are forced to fast as one of their five pillars of the Islam religion, Sawm, during Ramadan Month, everybody is focused on food after the fast. Since muslims have to fast during the daytime, all the markets and groceries are closed, and they are opened back up when the sun goes down, when the muslims are allowed to eat. Since the muslims are desperate for food at night, the prices of shops and restaurants go up since the shopkeepers and grocers know that people are going to buy their goods, so why not sell the same goods for a higher price? This also affects if muslims are going to be fed or not since some people can not afford food that has been overpriced, so they end up being hungry on rations until Ramadan goes away. 
The way of exchanging goods in Islamic regions has drastically changed over time. Muslims initially used commodities like gold, silver, cloth, silk and bronze, before an official currency was developed. Muslims started off as large desert people who could not settle in any place since they were little to no resources in the harsh deserts. Now that the muslims are settled, they accept paper currency. The growing economy made muslims advance so that they could make a great civilization enforced with Islam. After a long period of time, of trading in trade routes and caravans through the harsh deserts, people in the same region developed a currency to make trading and exchanging goods more simple, instead of using commodities. In conclusion, the Islamic religion influenced how the Islamic economy developed and grew over time.</h1>
