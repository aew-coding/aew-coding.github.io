    <h1>How Formulas Work Two Ways</h1>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>Formulas can work two ways but one things for sure: you still get the same answer. For years of math study, it was the 
    right answer that mattered in math, not weather or not you get it. But with Common Core, that is the main focus as their
    argument is that it will be more difficult to use formulas if you don't understand them, which is a way to remember them.
    Today, we will look at both formulas and leave it to you to decide which one is easier to remember.</p>
    <br>
    <h3>Original Way:</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Follow individual formulas.</li>
      <li>Annotate the problem.</li>
     </ol>
     <br>
     <h3>Common Core:</h3>
     <br>
     <ol>
      <li>Make sense of problems</li>
      <li>Reason.</li>
      <li>Prove that you're right.</li>
      <li>Do it ANOTHER way. (like maybe the original way!)</li>
      <li>No! You must use base ten blocks!</li>
      <li>Use a ruler. (but what about simple addition!)</li>
      <li>Prove that you're right again.</li>
      <li>Write an essay about it.</li>
     <ol>
