     <h2>General information</h2>
     
     <h3>


       <ol>Arenas are unique battlegrounds that are unlocked as you increase your Trophy count.</ol>
  <br><br><br>
<ol><ol><ol><ol><ol><ol><ol>Each arena will unlock new Cards, except for Legendary Arena.M</ol>
  <br><br><br>
<ol><ol><ol><ol><ol><ol>Chests can always contain Cards from Arenas that you have already passed (except the Legendary Chest, which can contain a Legendary Card from any Arena). Unlocking a new Arena adds new Cards to the Chest rewards - none are taken out.
  <br><br><br>
<ol><ol><ol><ol><ol>If you received Chests in a lower Arena, it will only contain Cards from that Arena and below, even if you advance to a higher Arena. Chests always contain the rewards from the Arena you fought in.
  <br><br><br>
  <ol><ol><ol><ol>The Goblin Stadium (Arena 1) unlocks the Shop and TV Royale.</ol>
  <br><br><br>
<ol><ol><ol>You receive more Cards through chests with a higher Arena level.
  <br><br><br>
<ol><ol>It is possible for the player to be matched with someone in a higher Arena and obtain a chest from that Arena without actually being in that Arena.
The Arena is 32 tiles long at its longest point and 18 tiles wide, and it has two bridges. The bridges are 2 tiles wide in arenas 1-6 and 8, however in arenas 7 and 9, the bridges are 3 tiles wide.
  <br><br><br>
<ol>This is proven by the fact that 3x3 buildings can fit on the bridge after a tower has been destroyed.
At the start of the game, the system will "give" you 6 cards for the first battle at the Training Camp; they are Arrows, Fireball, Giant, Archers, Knight and Bomber.
  <br><br><br>
<ol><ol><ol>Players can go 50 trophies lower than the promotion requirement of the same Arena, without being demoted to the previous Arena (e.g. You have to get to 400 trophies to get promoted to Bone Pit, but as long as you stay above 350 trophies, you will not be demoted back to Goblin Stadium).</ol>
<ol><ol>The chest level that a player wins depends on the higher arena between the two players. If a player from P.E.K.K.A's Playhouse battles someone from Spell Valley and wins, then they will get a Arena 5 chest even though they are in Arena 4.
       <br><br><br>
<ol>The first legendary cards (Lava Hound and Inferno Dragon) are available for unlock from P.E.K.K.A's Playhouse, and you have a chance to get one in any chest, albeit a very small chance.</h3>
