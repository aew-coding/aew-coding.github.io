  <h1> Valentine's Day Mailbox Instructions </h1>
  <br>
  <br>
<h4> 1. Get a 4 by 4 inch piece of white paper and glue a strip of colored paper, from the middle of the top to the bottom.</h4>
<br>
  <li class="mailbox">
    <div>
      <img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-ZxmlPsMVp7g/VbEs8p22YVI/AAAAAAAAAHQ/65looHBskMM/w800-h800/Hearts.gif"/>
    </div>
  </li>
<h4> 2. Get a 2 by 4 strip of the same color paper and fold it in half. Unfold it, put glue across the fold line, and glue it over the top of the white paper.</h4>
<br>
<h4> 3. Turn the paper over and measure 1 1/2 inches in the middle of the white paper. Then, cut the white paper to the 1 1/2 mark, but don't cut the colored paper that is folded over the top. </h4>
<br>
<h4> 4. Put a piece of tape hanging of the bottom of the white paper, and then curl the paper over and tape it to the top of the colored paper. </h4>
<br>
<h4> 5. Fold the ends of the colored paper up until they are right against the curled portion. Outline the folded ends and cut them so they are the same shape as the curl.</h4>
<br>
<h4> 6. Put glue on one of the curled over white paper and glue one of the cut ends of the colored paper to it. </h4>
<br>
<h4> 7. Take a clothespin and take the metal part off of it. Then untwist the wire twisted around the straight piece of metal. </h4>
<br>
<h4> 8. Glue the metal part of the clothespin to a piece of colored paper and bubble cut around it. </h4>
<br>
<h4> 9. Turn the paper-clothespin around and glue a heart on the skinny end. </h4>
<br>
<h4> 10. Glue the paper-clothespin to the mailbox near the open end, and glue the whole thing to a clothespin. </h4>
<br>
<h4> 11. Clip the mailbox on your card, and give it to someone you love! </h4>
