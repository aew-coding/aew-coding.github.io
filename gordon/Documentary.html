<h3> <p>Day 1.
  I have arrived in Antarctica, the dwelling place of the penguins. Right away, they are waddling about, honking left and right.
  A few of the parents are keeping their children warm in their....that's disgusting. None of them are capable of flight, but 
  they seem to be excellent swimmers. As for their diet, most of them are eating krill and shrimp, but Emperor Penguins eat squids.
  I believe maybe I should try and find shelter. It's freezing!</p>
  
  <h3> <p>Day 2.
    I've seen two or three penguin pairs mating, and I assume it's mating season. I can't wait to meet some adorable baby penguins!
    Webbed feet help them swim, and their crotches help keep their babies warm. Speaking of warmth, they cuddle together for it,
    but they refused to let me into their circle!!! :( Maybe they can smell the plastic eyes on the costume.</p>
 <h3> <p>Day 3.
   Oh no! I have just witnessed the death of a small group of penguins by the hands of predators by the hands of leopard seals and sharks.
   Hopefully I am not next. On the positive side, this gave me lots of information for my research. Curious, I performed an experiment.
   I put three skulls down on the ice, Penguin, Horse, and Human. As expected, all the penguins flocked to the skull of their species.
   One of them made a sound that sounded like crying.</p>
   
   <h3> <p>Day 4.
     I am losing patience. The climate here is uninhabitable by man, and I have been getting less and less research in. However, base
     has informed me that Antarctica is not the only place where penguins live, but I honestly think I should finish my journal here. Perhaps I
     shall venture underwater. After all, all 18 species of penguins rely on the ocean to survive. Coral Reefs are collapsing all across the
     world, though so I'd better hurry! So far, I'm seeing fish, more fish, and, HOLY MOLY! A POLAR BEAR! What a majestic creature, perhaps I 
     should study it next. Oh well. My ride has arrived, and so I'm off. Farewell!</p>
