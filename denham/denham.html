  <txt>When you think of Mario you think of a hero that saves the princess. BUT, YOU'RE WRONG!!</txt>
  <txt>You often see Mario breaking bricks,but do you know what those bricks are? They're not your every day gravity defying 
  bricks, but they're Toads Bowser turned into bricks. It says so in the manual for the first game.</txt>
  <txt> Look at the goombas defenseless little creatures who can be killed with the slightest touch, and Mario over here mercilessly kills 
    them without a second thought or even a first one, he just stomps on them with no regrets.</txt>
