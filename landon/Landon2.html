<h1>Welcome to my second page!</h2>
On my last page we looked at the top 3 best red shiny pokemon. Now on this page I'm going to talk about what moves they can learn, what level they learn it at, what type the move is, and the amount of damage that move can do to win a battle against your friends! I will even put in the pokedex entries for them! I hope you enjoy!
